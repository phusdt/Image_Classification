# Image_Classification
Every day, Google has to filter millions of different landscape photos around the world, then classify them into categories suitable for the search algorithm. Therefore, they need a computer vision approach to help them categorize the landscape photos that internet users have uploaded into the most popular categories.
<h5>Dataset</h5>The dataset is available for download at https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification
<h5>In this project:</h5>
Build a new CNN model and pre-trained <b>InceptionV3</b> (developed by <b>Google and pre-trained on ImageNet</b>) to predict 6 classes of images (building, forest, sea, mountain, glacier, street).
